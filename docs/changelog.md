## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 0.0.4 to 0.0.5

**Breaking Changes:**
- Configuration schema changes in `sara.yaml`
- New required dependencies (PyWavelets)

**Migration Steps:**
1. Update configuration files:
   ```yaml
   # Old format
   regularization: 0.1
   
   # New format
   gamma: 0.1
   l1_reweight_from: 100
   ```

2. Install new dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PyWavelets>=1.7.0
   ```

3. Update function calls:
   ```python
   # Old API
   sara_clean(image, psf, regularization=0.1)
   
   # New API
   sara_clean(image, psf, gamma=0.1, l1_reweight_from=100)
   ```

### Upgrading from 0.0.3 to 0.0.4

**Breaking Changes:**
- New operator architecture
- Modified CLI argument names

**Migration Steps:**
1. Update CLI commands:
   ```bash
   # Old command
   pfb clean --niter 1000 --gain 0.1
   
   # New command
   pfb kclean --niter 1000 --gain 0.1
   ```

2. Update Python API:
   ```python
   # Old API
   from pfb.clean import hogbom_clean
   
   # New API
   from pfb.deconv.hogbom import HogbomClean
   ```
