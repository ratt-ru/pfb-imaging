inputs:
  ms:
    dtype: List[URI]
    required: true
    abbreviation: ms
    info:
      Path to measurement set.
  scans:
    dtype: List[int]
    info:
      List of SCAN_NUMBERS to predict. Defaults to all.
      Input as comma separated list 0,2 if running from CLI
  ddids:
    dtype: List[int]
    info:
      List of DATA_DESC_ID's to predict. Defaults to all.
      Input as comma separated list 0,2 if running from CLI
  fields:
    dtype: List[int]
    info:
      List of FIELD_ID's to predict. Defaults to all.
      Input as comma separated list 0,2 if running from CLI
  suffix:
    dtype: str
    default: main
    info:
      Can be used to specify a custom name for the image space data products
  mds:
    dtype: str
    abbreviation: mds
    info:
      Optional path to mds to use for degridding.
      By default mds is inferred from output-filename.
  model-column:
    dtype: str
    default: MODEL_DATA
    info:
      Column to write model data to
  freq-range:
    dtype: str
    info:
      Frequency range to image in Hz.
      Specify as a string with colon delimiter eg. '1e9:1.1e9'
  integrations-per-image:
    dtype: int
    default: -1
    abbreviation: ipi
    info:
      Number of time integrations corresponding to each image.
      Default -1 (equivalently 0 or None) implies degrid per scan.
  channels-per-image:
    dtype: int
    abbreviation: cpi
    info:
      Number of channels per image.
      Default (None) -> read mapping from dds.
      (-1, 0) -> one band per SPW.
  accumulate:
    dtype: bool
    default: false
    info:
      Accumulate onto model column
  region-file:
    dtype: str
    info:
      A region file containing regions that need to be converted to separate measurement set columns.
      Each region in the file will end up in a separate column labelled as model-column{#} with the
      remainder going into model-column.
  output-format:
    dtype: str
    default: ms
    choices:
      - zarr
      - ms
    info:
      Format to write model visibilities to.
      ms will write to the model column of the measurement set (even a zarr backed one).
      zarr will write to a separate zarr file.
