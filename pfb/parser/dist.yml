host-address:
  dtype: str
  abbreviation: ha
  info:
    Address where the distributed client lives.
    Uses LocalCluster if no address is provided
    and scheduler is set to distributed.
nworkers:
  dtype: int
  default: 1
  abbreviation: nw
  info:
    Number of worker processes.
    Use with distributed scheduler.
nthreads-dask:
  dtype: int
  default: 1
  abbreviation: ntd
  info:
    Number of dask threads.
    This will largely determine the memory footprint.
    Used as nthreads per worker when using distributed scheduler.
nvthreads:
  dtype: int
  abbreviation: nvt
  info:
    Number of threads used to scale vertically (eg. for FFTs and gridding).
    Each dask thread can in principle spawn this many threads.
    Will attempt to use half the available threads by default.
scheduler:
  dtype: str
  choices: ["threads", "single-threaded", "sync", "distributed", "processes"]
  abbreviation: scheduler
  info:
    Which dask scheduler to use.
