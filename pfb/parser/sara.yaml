  _include:
    - (.)gridding.yml
    - (.)pdopts.yml
    - (.)pmopts.yml
    - (.)out.yml
  suffix:
    dtype: str
    default: 'main'
    info:
      Can be used to specify a custom name for the image space data products
  bases:
    dtype: str
    info: 'Wavelet bases to use. Give as comma separated str eg. '
    default: 'self,db1,db2'
    abbreviation: bases
  nlevels:
    dtype: int
    info: 'Wavelet decomposition level'
    default: 2
    abbreviation: nlevels
  l1reweight-from:
    dtype: int
    default: 5
    info:
      L1 reweighting will kick in either at convergence or after this many
      iterations. Set to a negative value to disbale L1 reweighting.
  hess-norm:
    dtype: float
    abbreviation: hess-norm
    info:
      Spectral norm of hessian approximation
  rmsfactor:
    dtype: float
    default: 1.0
    info:
      By default will threshold by rmsfactor*rms at every iteration
  gamma:
    dtype: float
    default: 1.0
    info:
      Step size of update
  alpha:
    dtype: float
    default: 2
    info:
      Controls how aggressively the l1reweighting is applied.
      Larger values correspond to more agressive reweighting.
  positivity:
    dtype: int
    default: 1
    # choices:
    #   - 0
    #   - 1
    #   - 2
    info:
      How to apply positivity constraint
      0 -> no positivity,
      1 -> normal positivity constraint
      and 2 -> strong positivity i.e. all pixels in a band > 0
  niter:
    dtype: int
    default: 10
    abbreviation: niter
    info:
      Number of iterations.
  nthreads:
    dtype: int
    abbreviation: nt
    info:
      Total number of threads to use.
      Defaults to half the total number available.
  tol:
    dtype: float
    default: 5e-4
    info:
      Tolerance at which to terminate algorithm.
      Will stop when norm(x-xp)/norm(x) < tol
  diverge-count:
    dtype: int
    default: 5
    info:
      Will terminate the algorithm if the rms increases this many times.
      Set to larger than niter to disable this check.
  do_res:
    dtype: bool
    default: true
    info:
      Deconvolve PSF to add intrinsic model resolution to dds

outputs:
  {}
